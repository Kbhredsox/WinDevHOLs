Hands on labs for Windows 10 UWP app development topics

These hands on labs provide a training experience where developers can learn through doing, learning about key UWP development topics by performing step-by-step labs.

These labs are also included as part of the workshops found at https://github.com/Windows-Readiness/WinDevWorkshop. They are provided here in this repository to provide a simple, smaller download than the workshop.
Additional labs will be made available here in the coming weeks.
